Jetmass2.0 is the next iteration of the jetmass analysis codebase. I don't plan to add any programming wizardry or bells and whistles; jetmass1.0 was simply getting too clunky, scattered, and chaotic as I heaped things haphazardly onto the disorganized pile of code. The goals for 2.0 are flexibility, streamlining, speed, organization, and clarity. And I hope it will be much easier after this to integrate the AA analysis once that is started.

Currently, the project only handles QA, but it will (hopefully) match 1.0's capabilities within the next week or two. A few tests of the QA have been done and it seems the pp JP2 of 1.0 has been perfectly replicated in 2.0 (exact same number of accepted events, etc.).
